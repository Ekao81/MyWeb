                <p>Hold onto your hats, folks, because I'm about to take you on a thrilling journey through the creation of my blog project, a.k.a. version 1 of my digital resume and web portfolio. This adventure began when I started a book called "SHOW YOUR WORK". It was like a lightning bolt of inspiration struck me, and I thought, "Hey, why not showcase my skills and talents in a dazzling digital format?"</p>
                <p>
                    Little did I know, this decision would lead me down a rabbit hole of redesign and reevaluation. You see, I hastily put together my initial version, thinking I had struck gold. But oh boy, was I wrong! After taking a closer look at Reddit post (someone asked if Web.devs keep a blog or anything as a preview of their skills link the post), I realized that my blog needed a serious facelift if it wanted to stand out in the vast sea of web portfolios.

                    So, I set out on a week-long quest to figure out how to revamp my project. It was like trying to solve a complex puzzle while blindfolded. I researched, experimented, and tinkered with different designs, trying to find the perfect blend of style and functionality. One moment, I thought I had it all figured out, and the next, I found myself questioning every pixel on the screen.

                    But hey, they say that the path to success is paved with a thousand iterations, right? So, I embraced the challenges and setbacks along the way. It was a valuable lesson in humility and the importance of constantly striving for improvement.

                So as a never finished project like drowned ship, in the depth of the oceans sleeps my Blog in the spotlight of this page as a memory of my first ever piece of creativity put together with HTML/CSS.
