        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Ayo I'm Erik! I really like and enjoy code front-end, I can imagine one day I work or have a business in such industry. I'm currently only learning in my spare time. My journey started 17th of June 2022 where i started to learn full stack with CS50x but somewhere around 6 months in I pivoted into web development. Where I started with freeCodeCamp courses and moved on with Kevin Powel's ones. This idea of building my own web began in book called "SHOW YOUR WORK". Which taught me it is really good to have some kind of a digital portfolio / resume. This would be the page one of IT. As my plan is to make always a new one when I feel ready and I got some new skills to show and implement what I learnt.  </p>

I would like this section to be maybe a kind of like a pointer to a direction for those who are interested in such a topic. This will be my findings, maybe a research site to all what I learnt in my life about mind-space. I will post interesting articles and literature that Im currently going / or i went thru. Also as Id like this place to be almost same for me. Id like to connect with random people who are also interested in such a topic and could point me in a new interesting direction in life as most of us are  looking for a growth. </H3>

            <h2>Sensory deprivation tank</h2>
            <h4>The thing I was always interested in sensory deprivation tanks but never tried them, how is maybe your insight on them? Is it worth to try? In my country these really are not common. So I yet did not have opportunity to try one. Also there is a ton of content from <a href="" class="joe-rogan" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kAgg2aLT08&ab_channel=JREClips">Joe Rogan</a>, he talks a lot about them I don't want all link it here, check him out!</h4>
           
            <h5>Sensory Deprivation Tanks: An Introduction</h5>
            <p>Sensory deprivation tanks, also known as isolation tanks or floatation tanks, offer a unique environment for relaxation and introspection. These specially designed chambers are filled with a solution of water and Epsom salts, creating a weightless and buoyant environment where individuals can effortlessly float.</p>

            <h5>The Experience of Sensory Deprivation</h5>
            <p>By minimizing external sensory input, such as light, sound, and gravity, sensory deprivation tanks create an environment that promotes deep relaxation and sensory isolation. Participants enter a tranquil, darkened room, undress, and immerse themselves in the tank. The water is heated to match body temperature, enhancing the feeling of weightlessness and comfort. As individuals float effortlessly, they can let go of their thoughts and embrace a state of deep relaxation.</p>

            <h5>Benefits of Sensory Deprivation Tanks</h5>
            <p>Many people find that sensory deprivation tank sessions offer various benefits, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stress relief: The absence of external stimuli allows individuals to disconnect from the pressures of daily life and experience profound relaxation.</li>
                <li>Pain reduction: The weightlessness and relaxation achieved in the tank can alleviate physical discomfort and ease muscle tension.</li>
                <li>Improved sleep: The deep relaxation experienced in sensory deprivation tanks can contribute to better sleep quality and overall restfulness.</li>
                <li>Enhanced creativity: The sensory isolation can stimulate creative thinking, allowing for new ideas and insights to emerge.</li>
                <li>Increased mindfulness: Sensory deprivation tanks provide an environment that encourages introspection and self-awareness, promoting mindfulness and mental clarity.</li>
            </ol>
