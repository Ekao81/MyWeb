        <p data-aos="flip-up"> I can imagine one day I work or have a business in such industry. I'm currently only learning in my spare time. My journey started 17th of June 2022 where i started to learn full stack with CS50x but somewhere around 6 months in I pivoted into web development. Where I continued with freeCodeCamp courses and moved on with Kevin Powell's ones. This idea of building my own web began in book </p>

        <p data-aos="flip-up">called "<a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/" class="show-your-work">SHOW YOUR WORK</a>". Which taught me it is really good to have some kind of a digital portfolio / resume. This would be the version.002. As my plan is to make always a new one when I feel ready and I got some new skills to show and implement what I learnt.  </p>

Since then I feel it changed my life only for better and now, that I'm a bit older, I started to notice how important good mental state is. So this is how mission begins, I want to at least try to push it a bit out there to the world, for everyday people, for young adolescent's, for people who feel like they need it and even for people that don't need it. Especially now in this age where people are so overstimulated from everyday life they sometimes forget to flip the switch... </h3>
           

            <h2>Idea - Creating a Haven of Mental Wellness: Where Coffee and Mindfulness Coexist</h2>
            <h4>Hey there, Today, I wanted to share an exciting idea that has been brewing in my mind. Imagine a coffee shop, a cozy haven where people can unwind, sip their favorite brew, and simply feel good without any worries. But here's the twist - my dream coffee shop goes beyond the usual experience and incorporates elements of mental and physical wellness.</h4>

            <h5>First step:</h5>
            <p>I envision a place where I can introduce everyday individuals to the transformative principles of mindfulness. Picture a tranquil space, bathed in soothing colors, and filled with comfortable seating. It's a spot where people can come and take a break from the chaos of life, finding solace in the simple act of being present.</p>

            
            <p>What sets this coffee shop apart is the focus on mental wellness and the promotion of inner peace. I believe in the significance of mental well-being, especially in our fast-paced world. Through this space, I would like to spread the word about the importance of mindfulness and it's profound impact on everyday life, especially for young people who are navigating various challenges.</p>

            <h5>Implementing mental wellness</h5>
            <p>So, how do I plan to bring mental wellness to the table? Well, I'm not sure yet. I like the idea that I could be hosting weekly sessions where I invite experts in the field to spread useful information to people about mindfulness. Engage in calming breathing exercises, and discover stress reduction practices. These sessions would equip us with practical tools and techniques to incorporate mindfulness into our daily routines.</p>
            <p> I'd love to have a teacher of the meditation, maybe 5-10 minutes throughout the day. Maybe even random days and random times so people come there for a nice relaxing time with a possibility of a learning something new that could help them with their everyday life.  The goal is to empower individuals like you and me to manage our thoughts, emotions, and overall well-being with grace and ease.</p>

            <h5>Physical side of this project</h5>
            <p>But mental wellness is not the only aspect I want to nurture. On the second floor of this coffee shop, I aim to create a space dedicated to physical wellness. Imagine a serene meditation center, equipped with sensory deprivation tanks that offer deep relaxation and rejuvenation. Additionally, I envision a wellness area where visitors can indulge in amenities like massage chairs and aromatherapy, providing a holistic experience for their mind and body.</p>

        
            <p>Through this integration of mindfulness and physical well-being, my coffee shop becomes a sanctuary for those seeking peace, personal growth, and meaningful connections. It's a place where individuals can come to relax, engage in conversations that matter, and take a step towards a healthier and more balanced life.</p>

            <h5>So what's the point?</h5>
            <p>My ultimate goal is to spread awareness about the importance of mental wellness and mindfulness, nurturing a community that prioritizes peace and personal development. I invite you to join me on this journey, where we can embrace mindfulness and create positive change within ourselves and our 
            surroundings.</p>
            

            <p>Let's make this idea of coffee shop became a real thing I promise I will try. I can't wait to welcome people to this haven of mindfulness, not just a spot for great coffee, but a hub of mental wellness and a catalyst for transformative conversations. For some it could help to find solace, and embark on a journey of self-discovery.</p>

            <h2>Sensory deprivation tank</h2>
            <h4>The thing I was always interested in sensory deprivation tanks but never tried them, how is maybe your insight on them? Is it worth to try? In my country these really are not common. So I yet did not have opportunity to try one. Also there is a ton of content from <a href="" class="joe-rogan" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kAgg2aLT08&ab_channel=JREClips">Joe Rogan</a>, he talks a lot about them I don't want all link it here, check him out!</h4>
           
            <h5>Sensory Deprivation Tanks: An Introduction</h5>
            <p>Sensory deprivation tanks, also known as isolation tanks or floatation tanks, offer a unique environment for relaxation and introspection. These specially designed chambers are filled with a solution of water and Epsom salts, creating a weightless and buoyant environment where individuals can effortlessly float.</p>

            <h5>The Experience of Sensory Deprivation</h5>
            <p>By minimizing external sensory input, such as light, sound, and gravity, sensory deprivation tanks create an environment that promotes deep relaxation and sensory isolation. Participants enter a tranquil, darkened room, undress, and immerse themselves in the tank. The water is heated to match body temperature, enhancing the feeling of weightlessness and comfort. As individuals float effortlessly, they can let go of their thoughts and embrace a state of deep relaxation.</p>

            <h5>Benefits of Sensory Deprivation Tanks</h5>
            <p>Many people find that sensory deprivation tank sessions offer various benefits, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stress relief: The absence of external stimuli allows individuals to disconnect from the pressures of daily life and experience profound relaxation.</li>
                <li>Pain reduction: The weightlessness and relaxation achieved in the tank can alleviate physical discomfort and ease muscle tension.</li>
                <li>Improved sleep: The deep relaxation experienced in sensory deprivation tanks can contribute to better sleep quality and overall restfulness.</li>
                <li>Enhanced creativity: The sensory isolation can stimulate creative thinking, allowing for new ideas and insights to emerge.</li>
                <li>Increased mindfulness: Sensory deprivation tanks provide an environment that encourages introspection and self-awareness, promoting mindfulness and mental clarity.</li>
            </ol>
